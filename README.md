# Radio-Galaxies
Code and plots produced during research project at Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy, produced as part of PHYS3003 and PHYS3004 (Physics Project) 2020. 

This code was my first introduction to Python and its modules. It is functional but could do with some refining.

An updated version of the radio to K-flux ratio plot was created for inclusion in a peer-reviewed article to be published in the 2021 Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia. Lead author is G. Drouart, Curtin Institute of Radio Astronomy.
